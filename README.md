Recipe website design

Goal: To design a basic website by only utilising html

This website is focused on several interesting recipies I have found on allrecipes.com. The website is intended to test my skills and knowledge on the following subjects:
- proper html boilerplate
- utilisation of html elements (headers, paragraphs, images, links, etc..)
- linking to multiple web pages with a navigation bar
- creating lists to explain recipe directions
